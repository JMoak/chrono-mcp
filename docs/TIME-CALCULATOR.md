# TIME CALCULATOR Tool Concept

## Overview
A comprehensive time calculation tool that performs arithmetic operations on dates, times, and durations. Complements the GET TIME tool by focusing on mathematical operations rather than formatting/conversion.

## Tool Definition

### Name: `TIME CALCULATOR`

### Description
Perform time arithmetic operations including duration calculations, date math, and interval operations. Supports business days, custom schedules, and complex time calculations.

## Parameters

### Core Parameters
- `operation` (required): Type of calculation to perform
  - `add` - Add duration to a date/time
  - `subtract` - Subtract duration from a date/time  
  - `diff` - Calculate difference between two dates/times
  - `duration_between` - Get detailed duration breakdown
  - `business_days` - Calculate business days between dates
  - `next_occurrence` - Find next occurrence of day/date pattern

### Date/Time Inputs
- `base_time` (string, optional): Base ISO datetime. Defaults to current time
- `target_time` (string, optional): Target datetime for comparisons/calculations
- `timezone` (string, optional): Timezone for calculations (e.g., 'America/New_York')

### Duration Parameters
- `years` (number, optional): Years to add/subtract
- `months` (number, optional): Months to add/subtract  
- `days` (number, optional): Days to add/subtract
- `hours` (number, optional): Hours to add/subtract
- `minutes` (number, optional): Minutes to add/subtract
- `seconds` (number, optional): Seconds to add/subtract

### Business Time Parameters
- `exclude_weekends` (boolean, optional): Exclude Saturday/Sunday. Default: true
- `holidays` (array, optional): List of holiday dates to exclude
- `business_hours` (object, optional): Custom business hours
  - `start`: Start time (e.g., '09:00')
  - `end`: End time (e.g., '17:00')
  - `timezone`: Business hours timezone

### Pattern Parameters (for next_occurrence)
- `day_of_week` (number, optional): 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.
- `day_of_month` (number, optional): Day of month (1-31)
- `month` (number, optional): Month (1-12)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Date Math
```json
{
  "operation": "add",
  "base_time": "2024-12-25T10:00:00Z",
  "days": 5,
  "hours": 3
}
// Result: 2024-12-30T13:00:00Z
```

### Duration Between Dates
```json
{
  "operation": "diff",
  "base_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", 
  "target_time": "2024-12-25T15:30:00Z"
}
// Result: { days: 358, hours: 15, minutes: 30, total_seconds: 30999000 }
```

### Business Days Calculation
```json
{
  "operation": "business_days",
  "base_time": "2024-12-20T00:00:00Z",
  "target_time": "2024-12-27T00:00:00Z",
  "exclude_weekends": true,
  "holidays": ["2024-12-25", "2024-12-26"]
}
// Result: 3 business days (excludes weekend + 2 holidays)
```

### Next Occurrence Pattern
```json
{
  "operation": "next_occurrence",
  "base_time": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
  "day_of_week": 1,
  "timezone": "America/New_York"
}
// Result: Next Monday after 2024-12-20 in NY timezone
```

## Output Format

### Standard Calculation Result
```json
{
  "operation": "add",
  "input": {
    "base_time": "2024-12-25T10:00:00Z",
    "duration": { "days": 5, "hours": 3 }
  },
  "result": "2024-12-30T13:00:00Z",
  "result_timezone": "UTC",
  "metadata": {
    "calculation_time": "2024-12-20T...",
    "timezone_offset": "+00:00"
  }
}
```

### Duration Breakdown Result
```json
{
  "operation": "diff",
  "input": {
    "base_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "target_time": "2024-12-25T15:30:00Z"
  },
  "result": {
    "years": 0,
    "months": 11,
    "days": 24,
    "hours": 15,
    "minutes": 30,
    "seconds": 0,
    "total_milliseconds": 30999000000,
    "human_readable": "11 months, 24 days, 15 hours, 30 minutes"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Operations
1. **Basic arithmetic**: `add`, `subtract` operations with duration objects
2. **Duration calculations**: `diff`, `duration_between` with detailed breakdowns
3. **Timezone support**: All operations respect timezone context

### Phase 2: Business Time
1. **Business days**: `business_days` operation with weekend/holiday exclusion
2. **Custom schedules**: Support for business hours and custom working calendars
3. **Holiday support**: Configurable holiday lists by region

### Phase 3: Advanced Patterns
1. **Pattern matching**: `next_occurrence` for recurring events
2. **Complex intervals**: Support for business quarters, fiscal years
3. **Recurring calculations**: Monthly/yearly patterns

## Value Proposition

### Complements GET TIME
- **GET TIME**: Focuses on display, formatting, timezone conversion
- **TIME CALCULATOR**: Focuses on computation, arithmetic, duration analysis

### Use Cases
- **Project management**: Calculate project timelines, milestones
- **Business planning**: Working days, business hours calculations  
- **Scheduling**: Find next available slots, recurring meetings
- **Analytics**: Time-based metrics, duration analysis
- **SLA monitoring**: Calculate response times, uptime periods

### Technical Benefits
- **Precision**: Handles complex timezone math correctly
- **Business logic**: Built-in understanding of working time concepts
- **Flexibility**: Supports both simple arithmetic and complex business rules
- **Consistency**: Pairs perfectly with GET TIME for complete time operations

## Next Steps
1. Implement core `add`/`subtract`/`diff` operations using Luxon
2. Create business days logic with holiday/weekend handling
3. Add pattern matching for recurring date calculations
4. Integrate with existing GET TIME tool for comprehensive time toolkit
